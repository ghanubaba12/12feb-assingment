    "An Exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are raised when a program encounters an error condition that it cannot handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors is that Syntax errors are errors in the syntax of the code itself and occur when the code is written in a way that is not valid according to the rules of the Python language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter when the code is being parsed and can be easily fixed by correcting the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program and can be handled using try-except blocks. Exceptions can be raised for a variety of reasons, such as division by zero, file not found, or invalid input from the user. The try-except blocks allow the program to handle these exceptions gracefully and recover from the error, rather than crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Syntax errors are caused by incorrect code syntax, while Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of the code."
